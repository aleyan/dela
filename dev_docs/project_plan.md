## Phase 10: Add MCP Support

This phase delivers an MCP server (rmcp over stdio) with a **quick-path** first, then **full background** support. MCP cannot modify allowlists.

### Phase 10A â€” **Quick Tasks Only** (finish â‰¤ 1s; background not required to use MVP)
Implement the minimal surface so editors can start using MCP immediately for discover/run workflows. Order below is implementation order.

- [x] [DTKT-141] MCP module & server skeleton (src/mcp/mod.rs, src/mcp/server.rs)
- [x] [DTKT-143] Wire DTOs for tasks with uniqified names (TaskDto)
- [x] [DTKT-144] Implement list_tasks with runner filtering
- [x] **[DTKT-160]** Extend `TaskDto` to **enriched fields**: `command`, `runner_available`, `allowlisted`, `file_path`
- [ ] **[DTKT-161]** Implement MCP allowlist **loader** (read-only) and evaluator (MCP namespace)
- [ ] **[DTKT-162]** Implement `list_tasks` enrichment: compute command, test runner availability, and allowlist flag
- [ ] **[DTKT-163]** Implement **task_start (quick)**:
  - Spawn the task, capture stdout/stderr up to **1s**
  - If exits â‰¤1s â†’ return `{ state: "exited", exit_code, initial_output }`
  - If still running â†’ return `{ state: "running", pid, initial_output }` **but do not persist/manage background yet** (documented limitation)
- [ ] **[DTKT-164]** Implement **status** that returns an **empty array** in Quick phase (documented that background processes are unsupported yet)
- [ ] **[DTKT-165]** Error taxonomy for **NotAllowlisted**, **RunnerUnavailable**, **TaskNotFound**
- [ ] **[DTKT-166]** Unit tests for `list_tasks` enrichment and `task_start` quick path
- [ ] **[DTKT-167]** CI smoke tests for MCP startup + quick start/exit flows
- [ ] **[DTKT-168]** Update `dev_docs/mcp_design.md` schemas and examples (this doc)
- [ ] **[DTKT-169]** README: quick MCP usage snippet + Inspector command

**Deliverable (10A):** `list_tasks` with enriched metadata and `task_start` that is already useful for short tasks (â‰¤1s). Background control is clearly marked as "coming next".

---

### Phase 10B â€” **Full Long-Running / Background Tasks**
Add PID management, output buffers, and controls.

- [ ] **[DTKT-170]** Introduce in-memory **PID â†’ Job** map with metadata (started_at, unique_name, args) and GC policy
- [ ] **[DTKT-171]** Add **ring buffer** for combined stdout/stderr per PID (bounded, configurable)
- [ ] **[DTKT-172]** Complete `status` to list **all running PIDs** with minimal info
- [ ] **[DTKT-173]** Implement `task_status` (filter by unique_name, return many PIDs)
- [ ] **[DTKT-174]** Implement `task_output` **tail last N lines** (default 200); add truncation flag
- [ ] **[DTKT-175]** Implement `task_stop` with **TERM + grace + KILL**
- [ ] **[DTKT-176]** Concurrency and safety limits (max concurrent jobs, per-message chunk cap)
- [ ] **[DTKT-177]** Optional MCP **logging notifications** while running (tracing + subscriber)
- [ ] **[DTKT-178]** (Optional) Resources `job://<pid>`, `joblog://<pid>?from=â€¦`
- [ ] **[DTKT-179]** Integration tests for long-running jobs: start â†’ status â†’ output â†’ stop
- [ ] **[DTKT-180]** Documentation: full background control, limits, examples

**Deliverable (10B):** Robust PID-based background task management compatible with editors, with log tailing and stop.
