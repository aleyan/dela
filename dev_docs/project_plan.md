# Project Plan

## Timeline & Dependencies

- **Phase 1** (Task Discovery & Parsing & CLI) is foundational and should be completed first.
- **Phase 2** (Shell Integration and Basic CLI) can proceed in parallel with Phase 1.
- **Phase 3** (Task Execution & Workflow) depends on both Phase 1 and 2 being completed.
- **Phase 4** (Security & Allowlist Management) requires Phase 3's task execution to be functional.
- **Phase 5** (Expand shell capabilities) builds upon Phase 2's shell integration work.
- **Phase 6** (Testing & Quality Assurance) can begin after Phase 4, running in parallel with Phase 5.
- **Phase 7** (Documentation & Release) should commence after all other phases are substantially complete.

Mark these items `[x]` when completed to track progress. This checklist format facilitates easy status updates for individuals and teams working on different tasks.
