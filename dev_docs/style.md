# Project Style

This project is extensively developed with llms, and requires affordances for humans and llms to be explicitly written into the repository. This means context is written into .md files for long term knowledge across multiple llm chat sessions.

This project uses Makefiles as a task runner for building, testing, and formatting and keeping other functionality in one place.

The folder organization prefers flatness over deep nesting.
